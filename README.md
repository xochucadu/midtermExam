# midtermExam

Challenges Faced During the Exam
During the exam, one of the main challenges I encountered was understanding the correct usage of certain Java constructs, especially related to file handling operations. I resolved this by reviewing examples, testing smaller code snippets, and debugging through an IDE.

Use of AI Tools During the Exam
AI tools were helpful in learning and understanding new Java concepts that were part of this exam. I used AI (such as ChatGPT) to:

Get clear explanations and example code for BufferedReader and FileReader usage.

Understand the syntax and application of exception handling with try-catch blocks.

Clarify the behavior and use cases of Java collections like ArrayList and generics.

The AI assisted with explanations, example snippets, and debugging suggestions. However, I wrote, tested, and refined the actual code myself to ensure I understood each part of the solution.

Limitations of AI Tools
There were cases where AI tools did not provide the desired results. For example, when seeking help with a specific file path error, the suggestions were too generic and didnâ€™t directly solve the issue. In such cases, I referred to official documentation and used manual testing to find a solution.
